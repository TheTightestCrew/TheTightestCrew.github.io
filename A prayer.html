<h2> <u> A Prayer</u> </h2>
<p>  Our Almir
who resides in steam wallets above
tightest be thy name
Our DLC come
our money will be done
On Earth in which dlc once was</p>
<p>Give us this dlc our daily car 4 mod
and forgive those who are not as tight
as we forgive those who try to untighten us,
deliver us from the realm of gaben below
and lead us not into a black hole of lean,
but deliver us from the untight</p>

<p>In the name of Almir, Lean, and the tightest tight</p>
