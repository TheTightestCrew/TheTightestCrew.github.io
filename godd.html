<p> Godd Howard was a poor sheperd in Bethesda, Maryland USA. He was inpregnated with Almir's child, "Yung Lean". Almir told Godd Howard that he is pregnant with a holy child, and that he would be the tightest human to ever live. Almir told Godd Howard that he is to raise this child and that Almir ain't payin' no child support.</p>
