<div class="gaben2"><h3><p> Gabe Noodle is the founder of valve, he is the least tightest person on the planet. 
A polar opposite to Almir. He is the reason that each season Sales occur. The Sales would be a good thing if he
 did not abuse the money, but he uses the money he earns to gain power. Instead of using it to patch the Black 
 Hole created by Yung lean, Gaben uses it on food to fill the black hole in his stomach. He uses it to gain power. 
 He is very obese, which makes him very loose. The opposite of being tight. Gaben is worshipped by non-tights. But 
 The Tightest Crew pray to him as well, praying that he will one day see the errors of his ways and then start 
 contributing to Yung Lean's hole. If Gaben didn't eat so much, he'd be tighter and less loose. Gaben is the 
 lord of Obesity, Profit, Good and Bad luck, Locksmithing, Crateloading, Weapons, knives, and hats that are on fire. 
 He used to be lord of Video games as well, before he stopped making video games in 2004 with the release of Half
 Life 2. </h3>
 </p>
 <p><h3> Gaben is not tight at all, because he does not release DLC like Almir. Almir is the tightest because he is a
 master of DLC. He gets even tighter when he makes 1000 DLC per day during Crimefest. He is super tight.
Even though Valves are made to tighten so they stop water flow, Gabe Noodle is the least tightest person on the planet.
<p> Gaben rules a realm called New Jersey, which is the realm that sinners against Almir go when they die. 
There are Biblical stories of Doctor Swifto going to New Jersey to rescue those damned to New Jersey. Fighting the free to plays and resisting the urge to buy keys.
New Jersey is a realm of locks and keys. The keys cost $2.50 each. Doctor Swifto fought many horrors in New Jersey. Even Gaben himself. </P>
