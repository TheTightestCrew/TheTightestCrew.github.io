<h2> Who are we? </h2>
<p> We are the tightest crew ever. Nobody has anything on us. We are the tightest in the world. Nobody is tighter than the tightest crew.
We are the original tightest crew. Been tight since my first night, of my life. You could never even dream of being this tight. The amount of tightness may seem impossible to the regular human brain. Our tightness is a paradox, wrapped in a riddle tightly, and enshrouded tightly in an enigma.
Yung Lean is a real human bean. We are the only humans who have reached this level of tightness. We were born to be tight, trained from infancy by tibetan monks the art of the tightest crew. Taken away from our parents at birth and taught the way of the tight.
One does not become a tightest crew, you are either born into it, or become one of the crew by proving yourself to the elder Tightmasters.

<h2><strong> The Code of the Tightest Crew </strong></h2> <p><strong>"Tighthood is Knighthood. Tight for life. Never forgetti. Tightness brings brightness. Tight for life. Never forgetti. Knees weak arms are heavy. On the surface he looks nervous but he's calm and ready. There's vomit on his sweater already. Mom's spaghetti. </strong></p>
<h2> <strong> Becoming one of the Tightest Crew </strong></h2> 
<p>One does not become a tightest crew easily, you must prove your courage, bravery and prowess in battle to one of the senior "Tightmasters". We were born to be tight, trained from infancy by tibetan monks the art of the tightest crew. Taken away from our parents at birth and taught the way of the tight.
One does not become a tightest crew, you are either born into it, or become one of the crew by proving yourself to the elder Tightmasters. You are either born intp the tight by a Tight father and mother who love eachother very much and make a child. Or you prove your worth to the realm of the tight.</P>
<h2> <strong> Features of crew members </strong> </h2> 
<p> Senior tightmasters develop the ability to time travel, make any voice and impersonate others, be invisible and super stealthy, to heal wounds by yelling "Pain is just mental, get up and fight" at the wounded or to yell "We need you buddy, get up!", and last but not least to be super strong and able to wear full body armor and move around with ease. They wear suits, ties, and typically matching masks. The most common Tightmaster wears aviator sunglasses and a suit. </p>

<p> Tightmasters are amazing drivers, serving as escape drivers and real human beans. After hours on end of radiation exposure from radiating tightness, and sometimes carrying nuclear bombs around casually with their inhuman strength, tightmasters almost have superpowers. Such as mentioned before, with yelling at people to heal wounds. They are amazing drivers, and can drive even when their eyes are completely covered. They can drift and are masters of driving 2fast2qwik.
They are masters of finesse, stealing from the rich and giving to themselves. They are so finesse that if they are shot at they can finesse the bullet right out of the air. They stole Ghaddafi's car.<p>
