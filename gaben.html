<div class="gaben2"><h3><p> Gabe Newell is the founder of valve, he is the least tightest person on the planet. 
A polar opposite to Almir. He is the reason that each season Sales occur. The Sales would be a good thing if he
 did not abuse the money, but he uses the money he earns to gain power. Instead of using it to patch the Black 
 Hole created by Yung lean, Gaben uses it on food to fill the black hole in his stomach. He uses it to gain power. 
 He is very obese, which makes him very loose. The opposite of being tight. Gaben is worshipped by non-tights. But 
 The Tightest Crew pray to him as well, praying that he will one day see the errors of his ways and then start 
 contributing to Yung Lean's hole. If Gaben didn't eat so much, he'd be tighter and less loose. Gaben is the 
 lord of Obesity, Profit, Good and Bad luck, Locksmithing, Crateloading, Weapons, knives, and hats that are on fire. 
 He used to be lord of Video games as well, before he stopped making video games in 2004 with the release of Half
 Life 2.</h3></p></div>
